# GitHub Work Item Analysis Command

## Purpose
Comprehensively analyze GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions using GitHub CLI and create detailed implementation plans based on current project state.

## Command Usage

```bash
/analyze-github-workitem https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
/analyze-github-workitem https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456
/analyze-github-workitem https://github.com/owner/repo/discussions/789
```

## What It Does

### 1. **GitHub Data Extraction**
- Fetches complete work item details using GitHub CLI
- Retrieves comments, labels, assignees, and metadata
- Gathers file changes and code context for PRs

### 2. **Project State Analysis**
- Searches codebase for related functionality
- Reviews existing patterns and implementations
- Analyzes dependencies and compatibility requirements

### 3. **Comprehensive Planning**
- Creates detailed implementation breakdown
- Identifies risks and mitigation strategies
- Provides multiple approach options with trade-offs

### 4. **Actionable Output**
- Step-by-step task breakdown
- Testing and validation strategies
- Best practice recommendations

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated
- Access to the target repository
- Current project directory with relevant codebase

## Example Output

The command generates a comprehensive analysis report including:

- **Work Item Overview** - Summary, status, priority
- **Technical Analysis** - Current gaps, patterns to leverage
- **Risk Assessment** - Potential issues, complexity estimation
